A practice project I realized as a **teaching assistant** along with the students utilizing the extra teaching time we got during lockdown.

# Project realization
Development of a Platformer game using SFML with the aim of developing OOP thinking, principles, polymorphism, design patterns, etc.  
The *documentation* of the code generated by **DoxyGen** can be found [here](https://oop-platformer.netlify.app/html).  
The *class hierarchy* can be found [here](https://oop-platformer.netlify.app/html/inherits.html).
